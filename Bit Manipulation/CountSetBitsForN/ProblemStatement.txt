You are given a number N.Find the total count of set bits for all numbers from 1 to N(both inclusive)

Example: 

Input: N=4
Output: 5

Explanation:

For numbers from 1 to 4
for 1: 001 = 1 set bit
for 2: 010 = 1 set bit
for 3: 011 = 2 set bits
for 4: 100 = 1 set bit

therefore, total count of set bits = 5

Example:
Input: N=17
Output:35
